The goal of `xprmntr` (pronounced: "experimenter") is to let users build behavioural experiments in R run through the browser, by providing wrappers to the [jspsych](https://www.jspsych.org/) javascript library. 

## Installation

The development version can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` 
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("djnavarro/xprmntr")
```

## Goals

The jsPsych library is organised around a system of *plugins* that generate specific trial types that can be used in a behavioural experiment. The initial goals in xprmtnr is:

- To provide "general purpose" wrappers that can be used to insert *any* jsPsych plugin (including any novel plugin)
- To provide a convenient API that wraps around the "standard" plugins that come bundled with jsPsych, and provides some structure for the user
- To allow the client side experiment (jsPsych) to communicate with an R server using the plumber package so the experiment can call server-side R functions
- To allow experiments to deploy locally, or github pages, etc. 
- To provide mechanisms to save locally, or to dropbox or similar cloud storage


## Notes

- The "survey" family:
   - jspsych-survey-html-form
   - jspsych-survey-likert
   - jspsych-survey-multi-choice
   - jspsych-survey-multi-select
   - jspsych-survey-text
- The "sr" family (stimulus-response):
   - jspsych-audio-button-response
   - jspsych-audio-keyboard-response
   - jspsych-audio-slider-response
   - jspsych-html-button-response
   - jspsych-html-keyboard-response
   - jspsych-html-slider-response
   - jspsych-image-button-response
   - jspsych-image-keyboard-response
   - jspsych-image-slider-response
   - jspsych-video-button-response
   - jspsych-video-keyboard-response
   - jspsych-video-slider-response
- The "categorise" family:
   - jspsych-categorize-animation
   - jspsych-categorize-html
   - jspsych-categorize-image
- Other... not sure yet
   - jspsych-animation
   - jspsych-cloze
   - jspsych-free-sort
   - jspsych-iat-html
   - jspsych-iat-image
   - jspsych-rdk
   - jspsych-reconstruction
   - jspsych-resize
   - jspsych-same-different-html
   - jspsych-same-different-image
   - jspsych-serial-reaction-time
   - jspsych-serial-reaction-time-mouse
   - jspsych-visual-search-circle
   - jspsych-vsl-animate-occlusion
   - jspsych-vsl-grid-scene
- "Meta???" family (not strictly "trials")
   - jspsych-external-html
   - jspsych-call-function
   - jspsych-fullscreen
   - jspsych-instructions
   - possibly have wrappers for loop nodes & conditional nodes here??


## Possible design:


- the "cue" family is used to specify the stimulus (broadly construed)
   - cue_html 
   - cue_text
   - cue_image
   - cue_audio
   - cue_video
   - cue_animation

- the "response" family is used to specify a response mechanism
   - response_button
   - response_key
   - response_slider (continuous)
   - response_likert (ordinal)
   - response_select (radio or checkbox)
   - response_mouse (???)
   - response_text (free text??)p

- the "simple" family is a simple construction
- the "survey" family: the trial is built from multiple questions; a question is a combination of a display_text + response_likert + response_select ...
- the "iat", "same-diff", "categorise" seem like they could be made to fit this framework easily
